public/private - access modifier

TYPES
=====
int, short, long, byte

long finish with l
binary can start with 0b

float - denoted by 3.234f
double - double as precise as a float!

Pretty much always prefer double.

char - can be hexadecimal representing unicode. E.g. \u03C0 is pi. These can be used outside of quotes, in place of actual code ðŸ˜±

MATH
====
use floorMod instead of % if operand could be negative

When two values are combined with a binary op (e.g. a + b) they're both converted to a common type, like float

CASTING
